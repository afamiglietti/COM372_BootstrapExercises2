    <h1>The Fixed Grid</h1>
      All grid elements must be nested inside a container. We usually only use one container on a page, and we never nest containers inside each other. This page uses the 'container' class, which creates a fixed width design.
      <p><strong>REMINDER: There are 12 columns in the grid system! So to use the full width of the container, your columns should sum to 12!</strong></p>
      <div class="row">
        The "row" class contains the columns. We usually don't put content in a row without nesting it inside a column first, because the row has a negative margin.
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2>Column Width 4</h2>
          This is a column with a width of four. It has padding to keep it from crowding the next column. It has a width of 33.3%, which makes it take up a third of it's container. It doesn't change size in the fixed-width display (except at responsive breakpoints) because the container class has a fixed pixel width.
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">

          This column is alone in it's own row. If it was in the same row as the column above, they would be next to each other. Alas, they are fated to be apart.

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2>Columns Apart</h2>
          The empty space between these columns is created by the four column offset on the second column.
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-4">
          <h2>Columns Apart Too?</h2>
          The offset on this column moves it far from the other column. Also, it just needs its space. It's not you, it's the column.
