    <h1>The Fluid Grid</h1>
      All grid elements must be nested inside a container. We usually only use one container on a page, and we never nest containers inside each other. This page uses the 'container-fluid' class, which creates a fluid design, taking up the full width of the page. Because the design is fluid (widths are defined in percent of screen, not pixels) it can fit the exact size of the browser. Fluid designs are powerful, but can also create challenges in maintaining alignment and sizing.
      <div class="row">
        The "row" class contains the columns. We usually don't put content in a row without nesting it inside a column first, because the row has a negative margin.
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2>Column Width 4</h2>
          This is a column with a width of four. It has padding to keep it from crowding the next column. It has a width of 33.3%, which makes it take up a third of it's container. It doesn't change size in the fixed-width display (except at responsive breakpoints) because the container class has a fixed pixel width.
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2>Column Width 4</h2>
          This is a column with a width of four. It has padding to keep it from crowding the next column. It has a width of 33.3%, which makes it take up a third of it's container.

          <h2>Lonely Column</h2>
          You don't have to use all 12 columns in every part of your design! This is a width 4 column alone by itself in a row.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2>Just Another Lonely Column</h2>
          This column is alone in it's own row. If it was in the same row as the column above, they would be next to each other. Alas, they are fated to be apart.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2>Columns Apart</h2>
          The empty space between these columns is created by the four column offset on the second column.
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-4">
          <h2>Columns Apart Too?</h2>
          The offset on this column moves it far from the other column. Also, it just needs its space. It's not you, it's the column.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4 fixed-height">
          <h2>Fixed Height</h2>
          I set a fixed height in pixels for this div, to demonstrate what can go wrong when fixed-heights and fluid design mix. As we resize the page the content "overflows" the fixed height container, with ugly results! (Note: You cannot set height in percent, only pixels.)
